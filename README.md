Spring Boot Employee Management System

A simple Employee Management System built with Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and H2/MySQL Database.
It provides basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing employee records.

Features
Create Employee – Add a new employee
Read Employees – List all employees
Read Employee by ID – View a single employee’s details
Update Employee – Modify existing employee information
Delete Employee – Remove an employee safely
Transactional operations – Ensures database consistency

Technologies Used
Java 17+
Spring Boot 3+
Spring Data JPA
H2 Database / MySQL
Lombok (optional)
Maven

File Explanations
File	Purpose / Working
EmployeeManagementApplication.java	Entry point of the Spring Boot application; starts the embedded server.
controller/EmpController.java	Handles REST API endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
entity/EmployeeEntity.java	Maps the Employee table in the database with JPA annotations.
model/Employee.java	Data Transfer Object (DTO) used in requests/responses; separates DB entity from API.
repository/EmployeeRepository.java	Interface extending JpaRepository; provides database CRUD operations.
service/EmployeeService.java	Interface defining business logic methods (create, read, update, delete).
service/EmployeeServiceImpl.java	Implements service methods; contains transactional logic and uses repository.
exception/ResourceNotFoundException.java	(Optional) Handles errors like “Employee not found” in a structured way.
application.properties	Configures DB connection, H2 console, server port, and JPA settings.
pom.xml	Contains Maven dependencies such as Spring Boot, Lombok, JPA, H2/MySQL.
API Endpoints
Method	Endpoint	Description
POST	/employees	Create a new employee
GET	/employees	Get all employees
GET	/employees/{id}	Get employee by ID
PUT	/employees/{id}	Update employee by ID
DELETE	/employees/{id}	Delete employee by ID
How the Project Works (Flow)

Controller (EmpController) receives the HTTP request from client (Postman, browser, etc.).

Controller calls Service (EmployeeServiceImpl) to perform business logic.

Service interacts with Repository (EmployeeRepository) to perform database operations.

Repository communicates with Database (H2/MySQL) using JPA.

Result is returned back to the Controller, which sends the response to the client.

Example: When you call GET /employees/1 → Controller calls service.readEmployee(1) → Repository fetches record from DB → Service returns DTO → Controller sends response.

Optional Enhancements

Add validation for employee fields (@NotNull, @Email, etc.)

Integrate Swagger UI for API documentation

Use MySQL/PostgreSQL for persistent storage

Add unit tests with JUnit and Mockito

Use Lombok to reduce boilerplate code
